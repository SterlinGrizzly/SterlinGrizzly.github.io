                <p class="bio-paragraph">Sterling Grizzly, above all, is a performer of all kinds, even when partaking on the visual arts the expressions of his visage are immaculate. I do well in scenarios of multiple people, hosting and entertaining are based on charisma, another quality that is well-embedded into my being. As an artist, my focus is performance and acting, although I do have a successful free-lance career as an on-commission Illustrator, working exceptionally well with people in line to ask for artwork.</p>
                <p class="bio-paragraph">Of course, my abilities do not stop at acting and drawing, I am also well-versed in paintings of all kind; Oil paint, Watercolors, Acrylics, Goache, as well as traditional drawing with Graphite, Ink, Soft Pastels and Oil Pastels. There is also the successful writing and interpretation of various theater plays; Dramaturgy and being a Playwright are extremely important aspects of my career.</p>
                <p class="bio-paragraph">During my free time, I like to work with masks, improve my overall artistic aesthetic by indulging in costume design and the ocassional music with my Violin.</p>

                <h4 class="display-4">My Artistic Journey</h2>
                <p class="bio-paragraph">Son of internationally renowned technician director and sporting director in the FIFA Ruben Subeldía, and Athletism excellence Olga Cabrera, Gerónimo Subeldía grew up in a strict education for perfection in sports, which forged a strong will and attitude to match, working from a very early age with kids from various summer camps he had attended as staff that his mother would develop as work experience. However his skills bloomed away from sports and into art as he grew up through creativity alone, gaining quite the interest in Biology as well. Deciding to go to a Technical High School instead of a regular, so as to focus on Industrial Chemistry before getting into college.</p>
                <p class="bio-paragraph">Gerónimo Subeldía would end up pausing his studies after high school to focus on musical training & language, as well as individual visual art practice, after which he would be accepted into two universities at the same time, those being the "Universidad Nacional de Asunción" for an LLB (Bachelor of Laws) that he would end up pausing after two years to pursue the "Instituto Superior de Bellas Artes" for a BA (Bachelor's Degree on Theater).</p>
                <p class="bio-paragraph">Naturally skilled to work with children, as well as having experience with all ages from his days of teaching English and English Literature, Gerónimo Subeldía obtained various skills such as Hand crafting, mask making, and overall being resourceful with everything he has done, as the conditions of the country he lives in aren't 'wealthy' in the sense of having to work with whatever is available on hands, however this gave Gerónimo a perfect training to make do with what he has in hand while doing scenography work or costume design.</p>
                <p class="bio-paragraph">He's ready for everything you can throw at him.</p>
